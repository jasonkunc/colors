## Color Tools

this is a small collection of web color tools

The [Color Shade Generator](https://jasonkunc.github.io/colors/color-shade-generator.html) is intended to show shades of a given color lighter and darker in 5% steps with the given color in the middle. 

The [Batch Hex Code Viewer](https://jasonkunc.github.io/colors/use-these-colors.html) is intended to just show a visual display of what a bunch of hex color codes are.
